If you need a stable release, use V0.3.8
Version 1.0.0 is out, but is not polished and lacks some side features present in v0.3.8


# PyAlly 1.0.0
Python3 wrapper for [Ally Invest brokerage API](https://www.ally.com/api/invest/documentation/getting-started/ "Ally Invest API")

Ally Bank's investment platform is perfect for smaller investors who value a mature web/mobile interface, and low brokerage fees. I made this wrapper so that I could more easily integrate the platform with Python, and reduce the need for human oversight on my account.

After setting up API keys, PyAlly can provide the basic/essential Ally brokerage transaction functions from a simple python request.
